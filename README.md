# Sales Report Project with Power BI
Why do we need to do this?
<br>Data is generated when a business starts its business process, synthesizing that data and creating reports showing the necessary indicators helps us clearly understand the operating status of the business.
<br>Indicators shown in this report include:
<br><pre>•	Revenue
<br><pre><pre>    o Total revenue
<br><pre><pre>    o Revenue by year
<br><pre><pre>    o Revenue by customer
<br><pre><pre>    o Revenue by each region/city
<br><pre><pre>    o Rate of increase/decrease in revenue compared to the previous year
<br><pre>•	Profit
<br><pre><pre>    o Total profit
<br><pre><pre>    o Profit by year
<br><pre><pre>    o Profit by business channel
<br><pre><pre>    o Ratio of profit to revenue
<br>    o Rate of profit increase/decrease compared to the previous year
<br>• Total goods sold
<br>
<br>From the information collected from the indicators in the report, I believe it can help us make decisions to optimize business operations.
