# Sales Report Project with Power BI
Why do we need to do this?
Data is generated when a business starts its business process, synthesizing that data and creating reports showing the necessary indicators helps us clearly understand the operating status of the business.
Indicators shown in this report include:
•	Revenue
    o Total revenue
    o Revenue by year
    o Revenue by customer
    o Revenue by each region/city
    o Rate of increase/decrease in revenue compared to the previous year
•	Profit
    o Total profit
    o Profit by year
    o Profit by business channel
    o Ratio of profit to revenue
    o Rate of profit increase/decrease compared to the previous year
• Total goods sold

From the information collected from the indicators in the report, I believe it can help us make decisions to optimize business operations.
