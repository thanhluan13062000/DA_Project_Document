## Overview:

This is one of my projects I did at Fullerton Health as a Data Analyst.

**Note: All data used in this project is not real**

In this project, I built the system from scratch, including:

- Centralized data from multiple sources through ETL process.
- Designed OLAP data model for analysis.
- Created DAX measure for KPIs and business metrics.
- Designed Interactive Dashboard for management teams.
- Managed Power BI Service for report publishing and access control.

## Data source

- Company Databases
- Company Sharepoint

## Tech stack

- MariaDB
- Python
- Power BI

## Implementation process

### Centralized data from multiple sources through ETL process.

Imported data from 5 different sources â€” one from the company database and four Excel files stored on SharePoint.

You can find all the SQL scripts used to extract data from the database in the folder here: [SQL_Scripts Folder](https://github.com/thanhluan13062000/DA_Project_Document/tree/main/FullertonHealth_Project/SQL_Scripts)

Below is one of the tables I imported into Power BI. Normally, I would perform several data transformation steps based on specific business requirements. However, in this project, the data provided was already clean and well-structured, so I only needed to promoted headers and changed column data types.

Load all tables to Power BI

### Designed OLAP data model for analysis.

After the ETL process was done and I had enough tables for data modeling.
