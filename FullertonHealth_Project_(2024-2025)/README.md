## Overview:

This is one of my projects I did at Fullerton Health as a Data Analyst.

**Note: All data used in this project is not real. You can download the full Power BI report file (.pbix) here: [FHVI - Claim Report.pbix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10bM1o_YF0BuL-8hVkMUOg5p64X19VnJw/view?usp=sharing)**

In this project, I built the system from scratch, including:

- Centralized data from multiple sources through ETL process.
- Designed OLAP data model for analysis.
- Created DAX measures for KPIs and business metrics.
- Designed Interactive Dashboard for management teams.
- Managed Power BI Service for report publishing and access control.

## Data source

- Company Databases
- Company Sharepoint

## Tech stack

- MariaDB
- Python
- Power BI

## Implementation process

### Centralized data from multiple sources through ETL process.

Imported data from 5 different sources â€” one from the company database and four Excel files stored on SharePoint.

![import_source.png](Pictures/import_source.png)

You can find all the SQL scripts used to extract data from the database in the folder here: [SQL_Scripts Folder](https://github.com/thanhluan13062000/DA_Project_Document/tree/main/FullertonHealth_Project/SQL_Scripts)

Below is one of the tables I imported into Power BI. Normally, I would perform several data transformation steps based on specific business requirements. However, in this project, the data provided was already clean and well-structured, so I only needed to promoted headers and changed column data types.

Load all tables to Power BI

### Designed OLAP data model for analysis.

After the ETL process was completed and I had enough tables for data modeling.

![datamodeling.png](Pictures/datamodeling.png)

In this case, the data model includes two business processes:
The Claim process, and the Customer Enrollment and Group Change (CEGC) process.
The Claim process has two fact tables â€” Claim and Claim Detail â€” while the CEGC process has one fact table, Situation. All other tables are Dimension.
The Date table is created using DAX.

<pre>
Date = 
 ADDCOLUMNS(
    CALENDAR(
        DATE(2000,01,01),
        DATE(YEAR(TODAY()),MONTH(TODAY()),DAY(TODAY()))
    ),
    "DateText", FORMAT([Date], "dd/mm/yyyy"),
    "EOMONTH",
    SWITCH(
        TRUE(),
        EOMONTH([Date], 0) > TODAY(), TODAY(),
        EOMONTH([Date], 0)
    ),
    "YEAR",YEAR([Date])
 )

</pre>

### Created DAX measures for KPIs and business metrics.

1. Claim Processing Indicators.

- Total number of claims received, settled and pending.
- Turnaround time indicators for claims, including the number and percentage of claims processed on time.
- Classification of pending claims by time delay zone to identify and prioritize overdue cases for processing.

2. Claim Adjuster Productivity

- Measures the number of claims handled by each Claim Adjuster, along with the number and percentage of claims processed on time.

3. Customer Lives

- Tracks the total number of active customers (lives) covered under insurance policies over time, enables time-based analysis (month, quarter, or year) to monitor customer growth trends and retention performance

**Total number of claims**

<pre>
Claims_Count_Measure = 
  DISTINCTCOUNT('Claim detail'[Claim number])

**Total claims settled and pending**

        [Claims_Count_Measure]
    )
VAR IN_TAT_CLAIMS =
    CALCULATE(
        [Claims_Count_Measure],
        Claim[In/Out_TAT] = "In TAT"
    )
RETURN
    SWITCH(

return
SWITCH(

    OR(_KPI=0,CALCULATE([Claims_Count_Measure],Claim[Beneficiary type] = "Reimbursement")=0),BLANK(),

**Tracks the total number of active customers (lives) covered under insurance policies over time**

<pre>

  CALCULATE(

      'Situation'[Policy effective date] <= CutOffDate,
      'Situation'[Insured expiry date] >= CutOffDate
  )
</pre>

**Note: These are not all the measures in this project â€” Iâ€™m only showing a few examples, because the model contains more than 50 measures. You can find all of them in the PBIX file linked at the top of this article**

### Designed Interactive Dashboard for management teams.

These are some dashboards I designed. Several of them feature interactive buttons to allow users to explore the data dynamically.

### Managed Power BI Service for report publishing and access control.

After completing the report, I published it on Power BI Service to share it with stakeholders and manage their access permissions.

### Final Thoughts

Thanks for checking out my project!  
I had a lot of fun building this Power BI report and hope youâ€™ll enjoy exploring it as much as I did creating it. ðŸ˜„
